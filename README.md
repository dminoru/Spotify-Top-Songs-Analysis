# Spotify-Top-Songs-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze the top 100 songs on Spotify by year. The first goal is to look at trends of the most popular music throughout the years. The second goal is to look at the variance in music within the top 100 of a particular year. 

The data is pulled from the Spotify API utilizing the Spotipy python library. Spotify creates a playlist of the top 100 songs for each year and this project will analyze the audio features of each of these songs. These features include things such as "danceability", "tempo", "instrumentalness", and others.
